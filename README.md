# MSc-Project
Code upload for my MSc Project
My project is an implementation of a Hybrid Machine Learning Technique. I used 7 Learning Machne Learning Models nd 4 Ensemble Learning Methods. In an actual implementation, it is meant to decide the kind of traffic is being received at a user end by using either of the models.
